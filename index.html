    <div class="content">
        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <h4>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into the other team’s goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.</h4>
        <h4>Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.</h4>
        
        <h1>Football History:</h1>
        <h4>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.</h4>
        <h4>The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished.</h4>
        
        <h1>About FIFA:</h1>
        <h4>FIFA is the international governing body of association football, beach football and futsal. It was founded in 1904[4] to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania) and CONMEBOL (South America).</h4>
        <h4>FIFA outlines a number of objectives in the organizational Statutes, including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.[5] It is responsible for the organization and promotion of association football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions.[6] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorship; in 2018, FIFA had revenues of over US $4.6 billion, ending the 2015–2018 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2 billion, and had cash reserves of over US$2.7 billion.</h4>
        <h4>Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.0</h4>
        <h4>Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter[11] and Michel Platini.[12] In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections[13] of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.[14][15] On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal,[16] FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert.[16] Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.</h4>
    
        <h1>Best football players:</h1>
        <h4> <span>1. Lionel Messi (PSG)</span>
            "But, Ronaldo dropped to 10th?!" I hear you cry. There's no trying to hide the fact that Lionel Messi didn't set the world alight in Paris last season, well, at least by his ridiculous standards.
            
            There's no doubt about it that Ronaldo and Messi will go down in history among the top three best football players of all time, alongside the late great Diego Maradona, but while Ronaldo's role has been boiled down somewhat, we're still witnessing the full-fat version of Messi.
            
            Messi is the reigning ballon d'Or winner after a stunning final season in Barcelona and after finally lifting a trophy with Argentina. His influence should never be doubted, his talent never down-played.
            
            Despite his rocky start at PSG, he still turned it around last season to score 11 and assist 14 goals in 33 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League. He has already started 2022/23 with three goals and two assists in three games, meaning we could be about to see another big season from the little wizard.</h4>

        <img src="../football/1245125342.jpg" class="playerimg">   
        <h4><span>2. Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona)</span>
            Lewandowski is one of the most in-form players in the world right now, there is simply no doubt about it. And he has been for some time. It feels like a great disgrace that he hasn't lifted a ballon d'Or in his berserk career.
            
            The Polish icon boasts a well-balanced portfolio of pace, strength and technical ability, and his movement in the box is sublime. His positioning is always on point and there's no-one you'd rather trust in a one-on-one situation.
            
            We know it's not all about raw stats, but we're going to leave you with some red-hot Lewandowski numbers to absorb. He scored 344 goals in 375 games across all competitions for Bayern Munich, including 41 Bundesliga strikes in just 29 games in 2020/21. He seems to be settling in nicely at Barcelona too.</h4>        
    
        <img src="../football/16667869053071.jpg" class="playerimg">
            <h4><span>3. Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)</span>
            In terms of raw effectiveness, you could argue Salah should sit ahead of De Bruyne, but in terms of the complete package, skill-set, technical ability, physical merits and mental toughness, De Bruyne may well be the No.1 complete footballer in the world today.
            
            He is the best crosser of a football in Premier League history and has played some of the most outrageous passes you're ever likely to see. On top of creating goals, he can also rip nets from their stanchions himself.
            
            This is all well and good, but what truly sets De Bruyne apart from the crowd of similar players is his surprising pace and physicality. The Belgian is a stronger than you may expect and at full throttle, he is a rapid mover with the football. He simply has it all.</h4>
    
        <img src="../football/Kevin-de-Bruyne-Man-City-1149333.jpg" class="playerimg">
            <h4><span>4. Kylian Mbappe (PSG)</span>
            Haaland's main competitor for the title of 'best player in the world' is without a doubt Kylian Mbappe. The top three players on this list are all 29 and older, paving the way for the Frenchman to dominate for years to come.
            
            He boasts acceleration that would put Doc Brown's DeLorean to shame and at the age of 23 he already boasts 110 goals in 117 PSG league games and 27 goals in 57 France national team caps.
            
            When Mbappe is running at you, there's little you can do but cry and pray for back-up. His close control is second-to-none and clinical finishing ability is the icing on the cake.</h4>    
        
        <img src="../football/Mbappe-1040x572.jpg" class="playerimg">
            <h4><span>5. Erling Haaland (Man City)</span>
            We reach the first player on the list with extremely strong potential to reach the hallowed No.1 spot on this list within a few years.
            
            Haaland has been magnificent since exploding onto the professional football scene. He was prolific at Red Bull Salzburg and made a mockery of the Bundesliga in a Dortmund shirt. He scored 86 goals in 89 games for the latter.
            
            At 6'4", he is a powerhouse that few can contain. Defences across the Premier League are learning this lesson the hard way as he transfers his superb form</h4>
        <img src="../football/ERLING-HAALAND-MANCHESTER-CITY-scaled-e1662531544452-1024x683.jpg" class="playerimg">
            <h4><span>6. Harry Kane (Tottenham)</span>
            Kane is quite simply one of the world's best strikers and well worthy of his seat at the top table in terms of world talents overall.
            
            Kane has recorded comfortably more than 20 goals every time he has played more than 30 Premier League games for Tottenham in a season. During the other campaigns, severely hampered by injuries, he has still notched up big tallies.
            
            The England talisman is more than just raw statistics though. His range of passing, his technique, his vision and playmaking abilities set him apart from almost every other striker on the planet. He is an outrageous talent who deserves trophies in his locker</h4>    
        <img src="../football/919ce34190522b6b64e8cda4719484900616c7d7.jpg" class="playerimg">
            <h4><span>7. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)</span>
            Salah's direct running could be viewed as rudimentary by footballing snobs, but there's no denying his effectiveness.
            
            He may not boast the all-round game that many above him in this list have developed, but there are few better players in the world at picking the ball up out wide and driving across – or into – the box at speed.
            
            He is Liverpool's talisman, their icon, their Egyptian king. He may have blossomed later in his career than many superstar names, but he will go down as one of the all-time Premier League greats without a doubt</h4>
        <img src="../football/3990198-Salah.jpg" class="playerimg"> 
            <h4><span>8. Karim Benzema (Real Madrid)</span>
            Benzema has made a booming return to the list as he continues to enjoy an Indian summer after almost two decades in the game.
            
            The Real Madrid talisman has been overlooked by Madrid for Galactico-style big-money names in recent years, but they always end up turning back to the reliable Frenchman who enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2021/22.
            
            He hasn't just made this list based on his 27 goals in 32 La Liga games last season, he has produced four back-to-back 20-goal seasons prior to this one with a stack of assists that are testament to his work rate, selflessness and influence in determining Madrid's success.</h4>
        <img src="../football/image.jpg" class="playerimg"> 
            <h4><span>9. Sadio Mane (Bayern Munich)</span>
            Mane's impact at Liverpool is maturing long after his departure given the Reds' current strife. His absence really does feel very apparent despite some of the bristling young talents on Merseyside.
            
            The Senegalese winger netted 16 Premier League goals last term and he's started life in the Bundesliga with three in three to introduce himself to his new club where he is, undoubtedly, the main man.
            
            Mane's incisive running has punctured many teams in his career and his big move offers him one more platform to tear up a division.</h4>    
        <img src="../football/210622101406-02-sadio-mane-file-0516.jpg" class="playerimg">
            <h4><span>10. Cristiano Ronaldo (Man Utd)</span>
            Ronaldo is one of the big sliders on this list after previously sitting firmly in the top two for over a decade.
            
            It's safe to say his best days are behind him as he approaches the final gambits of his career, but there's no shame in that and he remains a lethal tool in United's arsenal, even though it has been a rocky start to the new season.Ronaldo has evolved from pacy winger to talismanic centre forward and remains one of the best in the business when it comes to keeping his cool and scoring clutch goals at the death.</h4>    
        <img src="../football/ONLY_GERMANY_Cristiano_Ronaldo_Manchester_United_2022v.jpg" class="playerimg">

        <h1>Best goals ever:</h1>
        <h4><span>1. Lionel Messi (2007)</span>
            As the best player in the world, it is quite fitting that Lionel Messi has also scored the best goal. It came for Barcelona against Getafe in 2007, and it showed many similarities with Diego Maradona's strike 20 years earlier. From the same starting and finishing positions, he beat four players before rounding the goalkeeper to score. While there is little difference between the two goals, Messi's had a slightly better finish.</h4>
        <h4><span>2. Diego Maradona (1986)</span>
            Perhaps the most famous goal in the history of the beautiful game, Diego Maradona's 1986 World Cup strike against England was a moment of pure genius. He picked up the ball in his own half and beat four players and the goalkeeper before poking the ball into the net. Argentina went on to win the tournament with Maradona named as the best player.</h4>
        <h4><span>3. Zlatan Ibrahimovich (2004)</span>
            In 2004, Zlatan Ibrahimovich produced a goal worthy of the great Johan Cruyff. He twisted and turned, evading five attempts to win the ball before slotting calmly into the goal. The range of skills and dummies he utilized made it one of the best goals ever. His team, Ajax, won the game 6-2, which may bring the quality of the opposition defense into question. Nevertheless, it is a joy to watch.</h4>    
        <h4><span>4. Roberto Carlos (1997)</span>
            This entry is more of a tribute to the genius of Roberto Carlos. The spectacular video contains three extraordinary goals. The first is perhaps the most-watched goal in the history of football. Even to this day, no one appears to have reproduced Roberto Carlos' free-kick in 1997 that left French goalkeeper, Fabian Barthez, stationary and perplexed. Perhaps better, the second goal in the video features an impossible strike from the narrowest of angles.</h4>    
        <h4><span>5. Carlos Alberto (1970)</span>
            The Brazilian team that took part in the 1970 World Cup was one of the greatest in football history. Led by Carlos Alberto, the team included Pele, Jairzinho, Rivelino, and Gerson. They won every match in the tournament, culminating in a 4-1 demolition of Italy in the final. This final match saw one of the greatest team goals ever scored.</h4>    
        <h4><span>6. Marco Van Basten (1988)</span>
            When Dutch legend Marco Van Basten scored a goal in the 54th minute of the 1988 European Championship final, even the emulous Germans stood up and applauded. His now infamous goal was a strike of incredible difficulty, being a precise, powerful, looped volley from a difficult angle. The Netherlands won the final with Van Basten finishing as the tournament's top scorer.</h4>    
        <h4><span>7. Eric Cantona (1996)</span>
            This legendary goal from Eric Cantona in 1996 befitted his subsequent celebration. He beat two players before exchanging passes with a Manchester United teammate. He then chipped the ball over the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. Cantona celebrated by standing on the spot, slowly pirouetting as he took in the atmosphere with a vaunting stare to accompany his most memorable moment</h4>
        <h4><span>8. Dennis Bergkamp (2002)</span>
            Dennis Bergkamp was known for his sublime skill and ball control, but his goal for Arsenal against Newcastle in 2002 left everyone stunned. It is difficult to describe exactly what he did because no one else seems to have done it before. You could say he flicked the ball backwards around the defender, turned, and ran around the opposite side to collect it and score—but it's better to just watch and be amazed!</h4>
        <h4><span>9. Zlatan Ibrahimovich (2012)</span>
            In late 2012, Zlatan Ibrahimovich scored one of the best goals ever in an international friendly against England. When England goalkeeper, Joe Hart, made a poor headed clearance, Zlatan turned on his heels, leapt into the air, and looped an overhead kick into the England goal from 30 yards. While overhead kicks are generally lucky goals, the technique, composure, athleticism and accuracy demonstrated by Ibrahimovich was phenomenal.</h4>    
        <h4><span>10. George Weah (1996)</span>
            Many people will remember George Weah for the incredible goal he scored for Milan in 1996. He managed to pick up the ball in his own penalty area before running the length of the pitch to slot past the opposition goalkeeper. On his way, he evaded three defenders with consummate ease. George was voted the best African football player of the 20th century</h4>
